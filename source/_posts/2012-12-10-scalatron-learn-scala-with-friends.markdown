[Scalatron](https://github.com/scalatron/scalatron) is a **programming game** in which **bots**, written in Scala, compete against each other in a **virtual arena**.

Sounds like **fun**, how would that work? 

>â€¦get together with some friends, set up a server, attach a projector, order some pizza and start hacking! A Scalatron hack-a-thon may be the quickest and most entertaining way to get a group of programmers into Scala.

The [rules of the game](https://github.com/scalatron/scalatron/blob/master/Scalatron/doc/markdown/Scalatron%20Game%20Rules.md) are clearly explained in the docs, so you can figure out how to code the Master bot with his Mini-bots and their interactions with Fluppet, Snorg, Zugar, and Toxifera.

You can also [checkout the samples](https://github.com/scalatron/scalatron/tree/master/Scalatron/samples) to get a better feeling on **how a bot would get coded**.

A Scalatron evening sure sounds like fun, so [checkout if there's one happening in your area](https://www.google.com/search?q=scalatron%20site:meetup.com), or maybe even host one?
